## Sierpinski Triangle Fractal

## Overview
This project visualizes the Sierpinski Triangle, a well-known fractal that recursively divides an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles. Each generation of triangles is half the size of the previous one, creating a self-similar pattern. The fractal is implemented using JavaScript for generating and rendering the pattern, with CSS used to style the canvas. By adjusting the recursion depth, the level of detail in the fractal can be controlled, demonstrating the infinite nature of the fractal as the generations increase.
